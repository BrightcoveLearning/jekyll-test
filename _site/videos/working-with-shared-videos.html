  <h1>Working with Shared Videos</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to work with shared videos.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in  other  accounts. Media sharing is typically used when publishers want to keep a master account of video content and then share videos out to other divisions or subsidiaries of the organization.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Media sharing is available only for Pro and Enterprise accounts. If you are interested in upgrading your account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</aside>

    <h2 id="terminology">Media sharing terminology</h2>
    <p>This topic will use the following terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master</strong> - The account that created the original video. The Master owns the content and is responsible for setting up, managing and providing content to affiliates.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliate</strong> - The account that is receiving the video. The affiliate can accept content shared to it from a master.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="manage">Managing media sharing relationships</h2>
    <p>Before videos can be shared between accounts, media sharing settings must be configured (gear icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/gear-icon.png" />) and then <strong> Media Sharing</strong>). Note that only account administrators have access to the Admin menu. If you wish to share videos to other accounts, affiliates must be added and the affiliate accounts must accept the relationship. Master and affiliate accounts can terminate the relationship at any time. Terminating a media sharing relationship <strong>does not</strong> remove any shared videos from affiliate accounts. If you want to remove shared videos from an affiliate's account, you need either delete them from your own (master) account or open the video properties, go to the <strong>Media Sharing</strong> section, and click the <strong>Remove Video</strong> icon for the affiliate account.</p>

    <h2 id="sharing">Sharing videos</h2>
    <p>By default, the ability to share videos is available to all users in your account. To share videos, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open the <strong>Videos</strong> page, select one or more videos and then click <strong>More &gt; Share</strong>.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: When sharing large numbers of videos, Brightcove recommends sharing at most 50 videos at a time. Sharing a large number of videos at once may cause a time out error.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Select the affiliate account(s) to share the video(s) to and then click <strong>Share</strong>. The search field can be used to search for an account ID. The search field supports fuzzy searches so entering part of an ID will return matches.
        <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/media-sharing-select-account.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is possible to reshare videos (share previously shared videos to the same account). Doing so will replace any video metadata changes made by the affiliate account with the values from the master (sharing) account. Use caution when resharing videos.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="review">Reviewing shared videos</h2>
    <p>Affiliate accounts have the ability to configure an <strong>Acceptance Mode</strong> for each master account. When the <strong>Acceptance Mode</strong> is <strong>Auto</strong>, shared videos will appear in the affiliate account's list of videos in the Media module. When the <strong>Acceptance Mode</strong> is <strong>Manual</strong>, a <strong>Shares Pending</strong> link displaying the number of shared videos will appear in the Media module.</p>
    <p>Note: For information on configuring the Acceptance Mode, see <a href="/corp-comm/admin/managing-media-sharing-settings.html">Managing Media Sharing Settings</a>.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shares-pending.png" /></figure>
    <p>Clicking the <strong>Shares Pending</strong> link will display the list of shared videos.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shares-pending-video-list.png" /></figure>
    <p>From the shares pending list, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reject</strong> - To reject the shared video and not include it in your account. Rejecting a shared video does not prevent the master from sharing it to your account again in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Accept</strong> - To accept the shared video into your account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Quick View</strong> can be used to open a panel to view video properties. Once you accept a shared video, it no longer appears in the Shares Pending list in the Media module, and it appears in the All Videos view.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="view">Shared videos in the Videos page</h2>
    <p>Shared videos will display a sharing icon in the upper corner of the video thumbnail to indicate that the video has been shared into or out of an account.</p>
    <h3>Video shared into an account</h3>
    <p>Hovering over the sharing icon (<img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shared-in-icon.png" />) will display sharing details.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shared-in-example.png" /></figure>
    <h3>Video shared to another account</h3>
    <p>Hovering over the sharing icon (<img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shared-out-icon.png" />) will display sharing details.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shared-out-example.png" /></figure>
    <p>Master accounts can see the status of videos shared to affiliate accounts using the <strong>Media Sharing</strong> section of the video properties page.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/media-sharing-section.png" /></figure>
    <p>Errors may also appear here. For example, if <strong>Enforce custom field matching</strong> is checked, the affiliate account must have the same custom fields as the master account or any shares will fail.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/media-sharing-error.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="delete">Deleting shared videos</h2>
    <p>When a shared video is deleted from a master account, a message is displayed reminding you that deleting the shared video will delete it from all the affiliate accounts you've shared it with.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/videos/shared-video-delete.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="properties">Shared video properties</h2>
    <p>When a video is shared to an affiliate account, the following video properties are copied with the shared video:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Short and long description</li>
      <li>Reference ID (If any of the affiliate accounts that you are sharing with already have a video with the same reference ID, the sharing operation fails with an error message. You can avoid this by setting up reference ID naming conventions that prevent affiliates from using the same reference IDs.)</li>
      <li>Related Link (link text and link URL)</li>
      <li>Tags</li>
      <li>Thumbnail and poster images - By default, poster and thumbnail images for the master videos will be used in the affiliate accounts. If changes are made to the poster and/or thumbnail in the master account, those changes will be reflected in the affiliate accounts <strong>unless</strong> the affiliate account has previously generated new poster or thumbnail images. Once the affiliate account makes a change to the poster or thumbnail images, any changes to the poster/thumbnail made in the master account <strong>will not </strong>propagate to the affiliate account.</li>
      <li>Text Tracks - Affiliates do not have the ability to delete or edit the text track properties for shared videos.</li>
      <li>Scheduling start date and end date</li>
      <li>Custom fields - If the master account is configured to <strong>Enforce custom field matching</strong>, the affiliate account(s) must have the same custom fields as the master account or any shares will fail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note that if the custom field is a list type, the custom field must have the same options in both accounts.</p>
    <p>The shared video has all the values for these video metadata fields that the master video had at the moment it was shared. However, from that point on, the master copy and the affiliate copy become independent entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video files are not copied when you use Media Sharing, only the video metadata is copied. The shared video points to the original video files in your account.</li>
      <li>If the video is deleted from the master account, the video is deleted from all affiliate accounts.</li>
      <li>Any changes an affiliate makes to a video will not affect the original or any other shared copies. If an affiliate deletes a shared video, it is removed from the affiliate's account but remains in the master account and in all other affiliate accounts.</li>
      <li>Affiliates can't remove or update text tracks using the Media Module.</li>
      <li>When affiliates receive a video by sharing, it is in the active state. This is true even if the video was not active in the master account.</li>
      <li>If an affiliate accepts a video and required fields are missing, the video will be inactive.</li>
      <li>An affiliate account that receives a shared video cannot share that video to another account. Only the master account can share the video.</li>
      <li>Each account is billed separately for playback (video plays and bandwidth usage) of a shared video from that account.</li>
      <li>Reporting about a shared video is specific to each account and does not aggregate information about each copy of the video in each account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible to reshare videos (share previously shared videos to the same account). Doing so will replace any video metadata changes made by the affiliate account with the values from the master (sharing) account. Use caution when resharing videos.</p>

    <h2 id="billing">Shared media and billing</h2>
    <p>Brightcove often gets questions on how media that is shared between accounts affects billing. Below are a few scenarios that explain how billing is handled for content that is shared between publishers.</p>
    <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pub A and Pub B with content on Brightcove CDN</li>
      <li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
      <li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams and bandwidth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pub A using BYO CDN</li>
      <li>Pub B on Brightcove CDN OR BYO CDN (doesn't matter)</li>
      <li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
      <li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams; Pub A pays their own CDN for bandwidth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pub A with content on Brightcove CDN</li>
      <li>Pub B using BYO CDN</li>
      <li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
      <li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams and bandwidth assuming that the billing parameters are being passed. We have seen edge cases where the billing parameters are not being passed due to the creation of custom video players that are not properly passing the billing parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scenario 4 - Content must be fetched from Origin</h3>
    <p>We pass along the account ID&nbsp;in every request&nbsp;so that each account is billed for its own origin access. So if the <strong>Sharer</strong> account frequently misses its CDN cache and has to go back to origin for content, then the <strong>Sharer</strong> will be billed for that. If the <strong>Sharee</strong> account frequently misses its CDN cache and has to go back to origin for content, then the <strong>Sharee</strong> account is billed for that. Charges for Origin access stay seperate regardless of the CDN config scenario.</p>
