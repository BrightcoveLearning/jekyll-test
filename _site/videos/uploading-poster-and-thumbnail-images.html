  <h1>Uploading Poster and Thumbnail Images</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to upload poster and thumbnail images for a video.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Videos in your account have associated poster and thumbnail images. Poster and thumbnail images can be seen in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Videos list, the thumbnail image is displayed next to the video; the poster image will appear in the preview player on the video properties page</li>
      <li>The poster image is displayed in the playback area of the video player after the player loads and the video metadata is available; the poster will display until the viewer presses the play button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Poster and thumbnail images are created automatically by taking a snapshot from the source video at the midway point. If you don't like the default images that were captured, you can upload other images or <a href="capturing-poster-and-thumbnail-images.html">capture new images</a> to use as the poster and thumbnail.</p>
    <p>When uploading custom poster and thumbnail images, we recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Poster image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 16:9 and a minimum width of 640px</li>
      <li><strong>Thumbnail image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 16:9 and a minimum width of 160px</li>
    </ul>
