    <p>To upload videos to your account, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">

      <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>. The uploader panel will open in the page.

      </li>
      <li>Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Upload panel. The grey box becomes the drop zone. When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

          </li>
          <li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - Click <strong>Browse for Videos</strong> to open a file selection dialog and then browse and select files to upload.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After files are selected, the upload progress will display.  Click <strong>View and edit video details</strong> to view the video properties.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. <strong>While uploads are in a processing state, do not close or move away from the browser window.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"></figure>
    <p>When the upload is complete, a <strong>Processing Complete</strong> status will display. This indicates the processing has completed and it is safe to navigate from the Videos page.</p>

    <p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status is set to Active unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain Inactive until all of the required fields have values. For more information on working with required fields, see <a href="/node/15531">Setting Required Fields for Videos</a>.</p>
    <p>To learn more about video properties, see <a href="/node/15482">Editing Video Properties using the Media Module</a>.</p>

Select the videos to upload and click done. The videos from the mobile device will begin uploading and the progress will be displayed on your device.</p>
