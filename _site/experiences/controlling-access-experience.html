  <h1>Controlling Access to an Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to restrict access to an experience using access control profiles.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Access Control Profiles are used to control access to  experiences. Access Control Profiles are created as part of the Project settings and can restrict access using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requiring the user to enter credentials (SSO)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information on creating Access Control Profiles, see <a href="/corp-comm/experiences/configuring-access-control-profiles.html">Configuring Access Control Profiles</a>. Once profiles have been created, they can be assigned to  experiences to control access. To assign an Access Control Profile to an experience, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Edit your web experience.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Access Control</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Select an access control profile for the experience. By default, all published experiences are public.
        <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="select access control profile" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/select-access-profile.png" /></div>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure you republish the experience after making any changes to the access control settings.</p>
