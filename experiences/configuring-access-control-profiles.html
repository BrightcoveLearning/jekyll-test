  <h1>Configuring Access Control Profiles</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure access control profiles for an  experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>By default, when an experience is published, anyone with the site URL will be able to access the site. Access control profiles can be created to restrict access to an experience. Access control profiles are created as part of the Project settings and then the profiles are assigned to experiences. Access control profiles can be created to restrict access based upon <a href="#sso">Single sign-on</a>.</p>
    <p>To create an access control profile, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open the <strong>Projects</strong> page.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> link.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Access Control Profiles</strong>. A list of created Access Control Profiles will be displayed.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="profiles list" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/access-control-list.png" /></figure>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: You may see access control profiles in your account that you did not create. If you had configured IP restrictions, SSO or an access code for site(s) before Gallery implemented access control profiles, those settings have been saved as access control profiles when the feature was released.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Create Profile</strong>.</li>
      <li>Give the profile a <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Configure a <strong>Session Timeout</strong> to specify the amount of time a user's session will last. A few notes:
        <ul>
          <li>This setting applies when using SSO and Access code</li>
          <li>This is an "idle timeout". Whenever the Gallery server is hit (either through loading a page on the site or via an API call to the site) the timer is reset. This allows viewers to continually browse for longer than the specified timeout, but as soon as they go idle for longer than the timeout, they will be logged out. While a video is being watched, the Gallery server is not being accessed though, so the timeout value should be longer than your longest video.</li>
          <li>Your SSO provider must be set to either force re-authentication or to have a session timeout of less than our timeout. If it's not, we'll redirect to your SSO provider after our timeout and they will immediately issue a response that the user is logged in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select the option(s) to secure the site:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#sso">Single sign-on</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
      <li>Create additional Access Control Profiles as needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To edit or delete an access control profile, click the edit (<img alt="edit icon" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node16450-edit-icon.png" />) or delete (<img alt="delete icon" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node16450-delete-icon.png" />) buttons associated with the access control profile. Once access control profiles have been created, they can be assigned to a site as part of the site properties.

    <h2 id="sso">Configuring Single Sign-on</h2>
    <p>When creating an access control profile that uses SSO, site visitors will be prompted to login with valid credentials before they can access the experience. The Corp Comm app supports the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains.</p>
    <p>The Corp Comm app supports most major Identity Providers, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ping</li>
      <li>OneLogin</li>
      <li>ADFS 2.0 / 3.0</li>
      <li>Google G Suite</li>
      <li>Shibboleth</li>
      <li>Okta</li>
      <li>Salesforce.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other providers using the SAML 2.0 standard will also work. Corp Comm uses the <a href="https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml">passport-saml</a> library. Corp Comm does not support Identity Providers that do not work with this library.</p>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Corp Comm requires SAML 2.0 for single sign-on authentication. SAML 1.1 is not supported.</p>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: We only support single-byte characters.</p>
    <p>Your SSO provider will require an Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL). The ACS URL is listed in the SSO section of the Access Control Profiles table.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="acs url" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/access-control-acs-url.png" /></figure>
    <p>The ACS URL defaults to <code>https://auth.bcvp0rtal.com/login/callback</code>. You can also override the ACS URL by providing your own URL. Both of these options can be used for configuring stricter SSO providers. For existing sites, <code>http(s)://&lt;site-root-url&gt;/login/callback</code> will still work but Brightcove recommends that publishers use <code>https://auth.bcvp0rtal.com/login/callback</code>. This endpoint takes care of forwarding SAML data to the correct site for any sites that use a path on a domain.</p>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: When using an IDP-initiated SSO workflow, the ACS URL specified in your SSO software should point to a Gallery site which is configured with that access control profile. In this case, the <code>https://auth.bcvp0rtal.com/login/callback</code> URL should not be used.</p>
    <p>To configure an access control profile to use SSO, follow these steps:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="configure sso" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/access-control-sso-edit.png" /></figure>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Select the <strong>SSO </strong> option.</li>
      <li>If you have an export file of your SAML 2.0 metadata, click <strong>Select File</strong> to browse and select the metadata file. This will prefill the <strong>SAML 2.0 Endpoint</strong> and the <strong>X.509 Certificate</strong> fields.</li>
      <li>Enter a value for the <strong>SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)</strong>. This value should be available from your SAML provider.</li>
      <li>Enter a value for the <strong> X.509 Certificate</strong>. This value should be available from your SAML provider.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Enter the <strong>SAML Issuer / Entity ID Override</strong>. Enter a value here to optionally override the SAML issuer.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Enter the<strong> ACS URL Override</strong>. Enter a value here to optionally override the ACS URL.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Enter the <strong>SAML AuthnContext Override</strong>. Enter a value here to optionally override the SAML AuthnContext.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Enter any SAML attributes for that you want passed to your external JavaScript.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Check <strong>Expose all attributes</strong> to expose all of the SAML attributes for use in external JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
