  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to preview and publish a web experience.</summary>

    <h2 id="preview">Previewing a web experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing a web experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. To preview a web experience, edit the experience and then click <strong>Preview</strong> in the Experience Editor.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/web-preview-buttons.png" /></figure>
    <p>There are two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Responsive Preview</strong> - Opens the experience in a new browser window for preview</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Get Shareable Link</strong> - Provides a preview URL so the preview can be shared with others.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/corp-comm/images/experiences/web-preview-shareable-link.png" /></figure>
    <p>The Shareable URL that is generated is valid for 72 hours.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: If you have configured any session timeout as part of any access control settings, the 72 hour timeout will override your configured session timeout. When the experience is published, the session timeout (if any) will be enforced.</aside>

    <h2 id="publish">Publishing a web experience</h2>
    <p>Publishing a web experience makes it available to viewers and generates a static URL for the site. To publish an experience, follow these steps:</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: If you recently made changes to video metadata or playlists, those changes may take up to 6 minutes to appear on published experiences.</aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li class="language-editable">Click on the experience name to open the site in the Experience Editor.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">On the publish confirmation dialog, click <strong>Publish Now</strong>.
