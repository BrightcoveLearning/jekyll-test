  <h1>Capturing Poster and Thumbnail Images</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to capture poster and thumbnail images for a video.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Videos in your account have associated poster and thumbnail images. Poster and thumbnail images can be seen in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On  the Videos page, the thumbnail image is displayed next to the video; the poster image will appear in the preview player on the video properties page</li>
      <li>The poster image is displayed in the playback area of the video player before or after video playback</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Poster and thumbnail images are created automatically by taking a snapshot from the source video at the midway point. </p>
    <p>It is also possible to <a href="uploading-poster-and-thumbnail-images.html">upload other images</a> to use as the poster and thumbnail.</p>
