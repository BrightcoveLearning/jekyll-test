  <h1>Creating and Managing Playlists</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to create and manage playlists.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The <strong>Videos</strong> page makes it easy to create playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created your playlist, you can publish a playlist in a Corp Comm application.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="types">Types of playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the list of videos in the playlist is constructed automatically, based on video tags or other video properties. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your video library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A maximum of 100 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the manual playlist.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting. </li>
    </ul>
