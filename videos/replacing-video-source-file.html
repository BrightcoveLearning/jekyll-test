  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>There may be times when you want to replace the source file for a video. One common case is when you need to edit a video that was already published. If you delete the video and re-upload, you will have to re-enter all of the video metadata and you will lose any video analytics associated with the video.</p>
    <p>While the new renditions are being created, the video will remain playable using the existing renditions.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: You cannot replace the source file for videos that have been shared to your account.</aside>
